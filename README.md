# Collatz-Reference
A Proof of Concept for the Collatz Conjecture

## What is the Collatz Conjecture?
The Collatz conjecture is a theory in math about the following sequence: 
1. Start with any positive integer ```n``'
2. If n is even, the the next term is ```n/2```
3. If n is odd, the next term is ```3n+1``` 
4. Repeat until you reach one

You will always reach 1 for pretty much any number you can think of. Try it.

## Cool! How do I run this?

You need Python installed.
